### About react starter

This project contains react `v18` with Tailwind CSS `v3.2`. If you ready to learn react.js, definitely clone this repo.

If you understand Indonesian language (bahasa), you can watch the video course [here](https://parsinta.com/series/belajar-react-dari-awal-rswb0). I believe everyone should learn this cool library, so I make it all free for everyone who interested.

### If you want, you can sponsor my project by [Github sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/irsyadadl) or [Saweria](https://saweria.co/irsyadadl).
